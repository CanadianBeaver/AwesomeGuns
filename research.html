<h2>Research in the AwesomeGuns modification</h2>

<p>The big point in the game is on Research tree. AwesomeGuns modification changes a few of them and implements a lot of new.</p>

<h3>Biological research</h3>

<ul>
<li>Alien containment depends on alien biology which is necessary to understand how aliens live</li>
<li>The Alien food and Alien entertainment are necessary to prevent aliens from dying</li>
<li>The Alien biology opens the MEDI Kit which can be manufactured from alien corpses</li>
<li>Alien research and interrogation are important. These research are opening the alien weapons</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conventional weapon and Crafts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Improved interceptor (RAVEN) can be research at beginning. This aircraft has a great defence and does not consume Elerium</li>
<li>A lot of weapons from alien alloys were implemented for aircrafts and battlefields</li>
<li>Bullets from alien alloys which have a great power, acid ammo and Elerium bullets that can blast enemy and more...</li>
<li>New armours and equipments for soldiers were introduced</li>
</ul>

<h3>Laser weapon</h3>

<ul>
<li>Laser technology depends on Elerium and UFO Power Source</li>
<li>Research of laser weapon starts from craft cannon and laser tank</li>
</ul>

<h3>Alien weapon</h3>

<ul>
<li>Research of alien weapon depends on interrogation. Alien soldier, engineer and medic are necessary to move forward</li>
<li>The alien weapons are controlled by mind, therefore alien weapons can not be used by human without changing</li>
<li>The plasma pistols and plasma rifles can be converted for using in combats</li>
<li>The heavy plasma and blaster bombs can not be used in combats, but can be used in manufacturing weapons for aircrafts</li>
<li>The stun grenade can be manufactured from alien stun bomb</li>
</ul>
