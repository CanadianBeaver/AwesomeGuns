<h3>Research in the AwesomeGuns modification</h3>

<p>One of the biggest interest in the game is a research tree. AwesomeGuns modification changes a few of research and implements a lot of new. The main concept can be divided in four sections: Biology, Aircrafts and conventional weapons, Laser weapons and Alien weapons.</p>

<h4>Biological research</h4>

<ul>
<li>Alien containment depends on alien biology which is necessary to understand how aliens live.</li>
<li>The Alien food and Alien entertainment are necessary to prevent aliens from dying.</li>
<li>The Alien biology opens the MEDI Kit which can be manufactured from alien corpses.</li>
<li>Research the alins corpses and interrogation are important. These research are opening the alien weapons.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Aircrafts and conventional weapon</h4>

<ul>
<li>Improved interceptor (RAVEN) can be research at beginning. This aircraft has a great defence and does not consume Elerium.</li>
<li>A lot of weapons from alien alloys were implemented for aircrafts and battlefields.</li>
<li>Electromagnetic cannon for aircrafts and Rail sniper gun can be be investigated in the middle of the game.</li>
<li>Bullets from alien alloys which have a great power.</li>
<li>Bullets from CHRYSSALID acid can be used against alien tanks.</li>
<li>Elerium bullets that can blast enemy.</li>
<li>New armours with different opportunities for soldiers.</li>
<li>and more other innovations...</li>
</ul>

<h4>Laser weapon</h4>

<ul>
<li>Laser technology depends on Elerium and UFO Power Source.</li>
<li>Research of laser weapon starts from craft cannon and laser tank.</li>
<li>Laser weapons production consumes Elerium.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Alien weapon</h4>

<ul>
<li>Research of alien weapon depends on interrogation. Alien soldier, engineer and medic are necessary to move forward.</li>
<li>The alien weapons are controlled by mind, therefore alien weapons can not be used by human without changing.</li>
<li>The plasma pistols and plasma rifles can be converted for using in combats.</li>
<li>The heavy plasma and blaster bombs can not be used in combats, but can be used in manufacturing weapons for aircrafts.</li>
<li>The stun grenade can be manufactured from alien stun bomb.</li>
<li>Humans cannot build defence facilities based on alien technologies, but the Rocket and Laser facilities were improved.</li>
</ul>
