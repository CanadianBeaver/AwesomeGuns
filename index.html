<h2>The main ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>Aliens technologies cannot be reproduced</li>
<li>Aliens weapons are controlled by mind and can not be used in battles</li>
<li>Conventional weapons should be suitable as long as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of manufacturing were changed and were balanced. There are new production processes, new items and weapons were introduced, production of laser weapon was changed (now it consumes Elerium), Laser tank can be converted into cannon or rocket, alien items cannot be manufactured but can be converted, tanks can be changed into each other and more other.</p>
