<h3>The main ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do only the necessary changes. <b style="color:#778899;font-size:1rem">This modification is not a dump of different other mods.</b></li>
<li>Aircrafts and weapons should be balanced and a little difficult to use.</li>
<li>Alien technologies cannot be manufactured and reproduced.</li>
<li>Alien weapons are controlled by mind and can not be used in the combats.</li>
<li>Fortunately, alien weapons can be redone and used in different cases.</li>
<li>Conventional weapons should be suitable as long as possible.</li>
<li>Improve the visualization without compromises.<br/><small>Be aware, all introduced images, sounds and ideas were checked and corrected. All weapons and hit animation were made is same colour style. Weapon shooting sounds and hits have been improved.</small></li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<ul>
<li>It should work on Windows and Linux without problems.<br/><small>The stable version of OpenXcom (1.0) should remain be <b style="color:#778899">stable and playable - this is the main point</b>.</small></li>
<li>Let in the combats will be more different pistols, rifles, even grenade launchers and more different types of guns.</li>
<li>Also, let the soldiers use different armours with different colours and possibilities.</li>
<li>Moreover, let be more explosives in in the battles, more incendiary weapons and more smoke.</li>
<li>IRONMAN? - Pourquoi pas? Let's play hard and without savings. À la guerre comme à la guerre.</li>
<li>Some of English articles can be improved, because the English is not my first language.<br/><small><b style="color:#778899">You are wanted.</b> Please feel free to help me - <a href="mailto:ontariobeaver@gmail.com">email</a>.</small></li>
</ul>

<h3>Starting base and facilities</h3>
<p>Layout of facilities on the starting base has been improved for better defence. The small radar system in the center gives free space for maneuvers. The living quarters before small radar can be used for close range combat, becouse it is a good place for ambush. Building the large radar system bellow small radar proposes a good place for snipers.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/research/screen002.png" /></div>
<p>The alien containment depends on Alien Biology. An autopsy of any alien is necessary for it. Range of radars were balanced for aircrafts and facilities. In addition, the construction of facilities was balanced. And a small gift - there is cannon tank at the beginning of the game which can be turn into a laser tank later.</p>

<h3>Aircrafts and cannons</h3>
<p>Aircrafts and cannons were rebalanced. New improved interceptor (RAVEN) was implemented. In addition, the Lightning image has been enhanced. Existing cannons were restyled. A lot of cannons were added. <a href="crafts.html" class="readmore" >read more...</a></p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/crafts/arsenal.png"/></div>

<h3>Conventional weapon</h3>
<p>AwesomeGuns modification implements a lot of new guns and items in addition to the existing pistols, rifles and cannons. There are the machine pistols, sniper rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers with different type of grenades and armor-penetrating rocket which can ruin wall of UFO. Moreover, incendiary grenades, medi chests and motion scanners are available from beginning. Also, the assault rifles and thunderbolt (a heavy sniper rifle) can be researched after alien alloys.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/weapons/conventional.png"/></div>
<p>The bullets are not an exception - improved clips can be manufactured from alien alloys, alien corpses and Elerium. All these and many other items and weapons give an unforgettable experience. <a href="weapons.html#conventional" class="readmore" >read more...</a></p>
 
<h3>Laser weapon</h3>
<p>The laser technology can be researched after Elerium and UFO power source. Unfortunately, the laser weapon overheats and cannot fire auto shots. Fortunately, the laser weapon is very accurate. Also, the laser shotgun has a great power. <a href="weapons.html#laser" class="readmore" >read more...</a></p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/weapons/laser.png"/></div>

<h3>Alien weapon</h3>
<p>The alien weapons were completely restyled. Now these guns look really like extraterrestrial weapon. Moreover, the hand's and floor's images, the sound's files and hit animation were improved. <a href="weapons.html#alien" class="readmore" >read more...</a></p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/weapons/alien.png"/></div>
<p>Converted plasma pistols and plasma rifles can be used in the combats. These weapons were restyled also and look pretty good now.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/weapons/converted.png"/></div>

<h3>Armours</h3>
<p>New vests are allowed to buy at beginning of the game. Also, new armours can be researched after alien alloys. AwesomeGuns modification implements different types of armours with different colours and possibilities. There are armours for scouts, snipers and heavy gun soldiers. The inventory and combats images have been corrected. <a href="armours.html" class="readmore" >read more...</a></p>

<h3>Inventory screen</h3>
<p>Inventory has been redeveloped. New quik-draw and breast sections were implemented. Shifting items between hand and holster is more quickly.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/research/screen001.png" /></div>

<h3>Did you play DOOM II?</h3>
<div align="center"><img src="images/research/screen010.png" /></div>
<p>It is funny, is not it?</p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Research in the AwesomeGuns modification conducts four sections: Biology, Aircrafts and conventional weapons, Laser weapons and Alien weapons. These implementations give a lot of different guns and items. <a href="research.html" class="readmore">read more...</a></p>

<h3>Manufacture</h3>
<p>Some of manufacturing were changed and were balanced. There are new production processes, new items, bullets and weapons were introduced, production of laser weapons has been changed (now it consumes Elerium), human tanks can be turned into each other (Laser can be modified as Tank Cannon, Tank Cannon as Tank Rocket), alien items and weapon cannot be manufactured but can be converted into other items and more other.</p>

<h3>Geoscape cities</h3>
<p>Many cities have been added to the globe in all regions. This will make the game more interesting.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/crafts/screen024.png"/></div>

<h3>Enjoy your time</h3>
<p>A lot of other innovation that AwesomeGuns offers can be discovered in the game. Try and play.</p>
<p>AwesomeGuns modification released under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_3">GPLv3</a>. You can play and use it for free. Do not forget to make a reference to this web-site, if you have plans to fork it.</p>

<h3>Compatible mods</h3>
<p>I avoid to make changes in alien's missions or UFOs. There are a few mods for this and they work fine with my creation. I recommend to use these mods:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.openxcom.com/mod/lukes-expanded-terror-mission">Lukes Expanded Terror Mission</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.openxcom.com/mod/solar-039-s-new-ufos">Solar's New UFOs</a> (be aware, only version 1.1 is for stable game's release)</li>
</ul>
<p>AwesomeGuns modification can be incompatible with previous saved files, because inventory is redone. To avoid problems with previous saved files your soldiers should be stripped before saving.</p>
<p>I got images and ideas from many mods, but I never copy these without adaptation. Basic of them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>X-Com Weapon Rework and Expansion - 0.8.5</li>
<li>XenoOperations - the biggest special thanks to XOps who is the author and who allowed me to use images of plasma weapon</li>
