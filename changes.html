<div align="center"><img src="images/ui/DOOMII.png" /></div>
<p>It is funny, is not it?</p>

<h4>Battlescape control panel</h4>
<p>Just a small change for a better view during combats</p>

<h4>Research</h4>
<p>Research in the AwesomeGuns modification conducts four sections: Biology, Aircrafts and conventional weapons, Laser weapons and Alien weapons. These implementations give a lot of different guns and items. <a href="research.html" class="readmore">read more...</a></p>

<h4>Manufacture</h4>
<p>Some of manufacturing were changed and were balanced. There are new production processes, new items, bullets and weapons were introduced, production of laser weapons has been changed (now it consumes Elerium), human tanks can be turned into each other (Tank/Laser can be modified as Tank/Cannon, Tank/Cannon as Tank/Rocket), alien items and weapon cannot be manufactured but can be converted into other items and more other.</p>

<h4>Geoscape cities</h4>
<p>Many cities have been added to the globe in all regions. This will make the game more interesting.</p>
