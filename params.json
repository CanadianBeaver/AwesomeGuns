Even though a lot of people and companies tried to embody ideas of this game in their creations, the original plot of UFO Defense has never been improved. Today I am happy, because [a group of people](https://github.com/SupSuper/OpenXcom/graphs/contributors) is reproducing the original plot and the original graphics of this game with great possibilities for mod makers. The name of this project is [OpenXCom](https://github.com/SupSuper/OpenXcom) and fortunately it can be run on Linux. Despite the fact that OpenXCom is awesome I would like to introduce my collection of changes for this game plot and graphics.\r\n\r\n#AwesomeGuns\r\n\r\nThis is a mod for OpenXCom game. [Read more...](DESCRIPTION.md)\r\n\r\n###Why am I doing it?\r\n\r\nOriginal gameplay of X-COM: UFO Defense has a big problem in the middle and in the end of game. The game can make you feel bored. There are a steam of small UFOs, the monotonous and repetitive missions, the heavy plasma has no alternative...  My suggestion to improve this situation is to make more efficient conventional weapons. Let the soldiers use different pistols, rifles, even grenade launchers and more different types of guns. Also, let the soldiers use different armours with different colours and possibilities. Moreover, let be more explosives in in the battles, more incendiary weapons and more smoke.\r\n\r\nI researched [a lot of mods](http://www.openxcom.com/mods) for OpenXCom and found that there are two types of mods. Main ones are simple and perfect, but they do not combine together nicely. Another mods are like a dump of different mods that will never work. Unfortunately, a lot of mods were made for night game's release and do not work for the stable game's release.\r\n\r\nI prefer the [Debian](https://www.debian.org/). It is stable, it is simple and it is a minimum necessary. I would like to make a mod with the same ideas. It should be stable, it should work for the stable game release, it should be simple and it should make only necessary changes.\r\n\r\nIf you have the same preferences, I would like to invite you to create it together.\r\n\r\n###How do I make it?\r\n\r\n- Primary, I am used to working with the [Debian and Mate](https://wiki.debian.org/Mate). I hope this mod will work fine on other platforms without problems.\r\n- Secondary, I used to work with the [Geany](https://www.geany.org/). Unfortunately, this text editor is not good for yaml structures. Now, I'm used to working with [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) without purchasing a license. This text editor is OK, but it disturbs me a hundred times per day due to the purchase of a license. Please feel free to offer me if you know another great text editor for yaml structures.\r\n- I am used to working with the [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) for correct images. I am not a good painter. Therefore, I collect images from another mods. I change some images, but a lot of images I introduce without changes.\r\n- The [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) and [Dia](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia/) for creating text and diagrams.\r\n- And at final, of course I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and GitHub. This is my first experience with Git and my first project on GitHub.\r\n\r\n###The main ideas\r\n\r\n- Do only the necessary changes.\r\n- Do not copy ideas or implementations from another mods without checking, adaptation and improvement.\r\n- Alien's technologies is impossible for implementing. Therefore, we can't manufacture plasma or fusion weapons, but our soldiers can use it in the battle.\r\n- Conventional weapons should be suitable as long as possible\r\n- Armour should be more different and more specialized. There are armor for snipers, for heavy soldiers, for supports. It is difficult for realization, because the game doesn't have soldier's specialization, but it can be done.\r\n- Realistic balance for crafts, shooting, alien's protection.\r\n- Some changes just for fun...\r\n\r\n##How to install it?\r\n\r\n* Copy the *Ruleset/AwesomeGuns.rul* file into your *openxcom/data/Ruleset* folder.\r\n* Copy the *Resources/AwesomeGuns* folder into your *openxcom/data/Resources* folder.\r\n* The folder *Descriptions* contains only work documents. Files in this folder are using just for description and development process.\r\n\r\n###Compatible mods:\r\n\r\nI avoid to make changes in alien's missions or UFOs. There are a few mods for this and they work fine with my creation. I recommend to use these mods:\r\n- [Lukes Expanded Terror Mission](http://www.openxcom.com/mod/lukes-expanded-terror-mission)\r\n- [Solar's New UFOs](http://www.openxcom.com/mod/solar-039-s-new-ufos) (be aware, only version 1.1 is for stable game's release)\r\n\r\n###Special thanks\r\n\r\nI got images and ideas from many mods, but I never copy these without adaptation. Basic of them are:\r\n- X-Com Weapon Rework and Expansion - 0.8.5\r\n- Weapon Rework/Expansion\r\n- Robin's Extra Weapons\r\n- Improved Hand Objects\r\n- AlienInventory\r\n- NewTUReserveUI\r\n- 2012DeathSounds\r\n- CraftMissleSound\r\n- Doom_Skill_Levels\r\n- Laser Rifle Recolor\r\n- GrenadeLauncher\r\n- Incendiary_grenade_24jul\r\n- ImprovedHandObsPack\r\n- EqualTerms1.03\r\n- Equal Terms (Prime alpha)\r\n- Ryskeliini_GunsNGadgets_1st_pack_v12\r\n- OpticalEleriumV0-94b\r\n- TinyResearchMod 1.0\r\n- Raven\r\n- Air Combat Rebalanced\r\n- Railgun\r\n- Better look personal armor\r\n- Armored Vest\r\n- Scout Power Armor\r\n- Stormhawk\r\n- Quick-Draw Hip Slot\r\n- Reproduction\r\n- FastRamp\r\n- HQSounds_FinalModPack\r\n",
