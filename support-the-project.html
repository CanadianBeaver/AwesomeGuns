  <dd>Many thanks for your mod. Of all OXC mods i have tried recently, your mod i enjoyed  most.
  And special thanks for the "reinvention" of the LAW (a disposable rocket launcher with HEAT warhead).</dd>
  
  <dt>ThirtyFour <date>August 22, 2016</date></dt>
  <dd>This is the best mod for xcom that I've played. You very clearly have an attention to detail and 
  there is excellent balance between the weapons and game functions you've added. I really like that 
  you've measured ammo counts to keep things balanced and the quick draw inventory slot was a very good 
  idea that has me using pistols for about the first time ever. I hope to see more work from you soon.</dd>

  <dt>niculinux <date>August 15, 2016</date></dt>
  <dd>Super! Hope on next version we may get a couple of coverted aliens weapons more :)</dd>

  <dt>The_Atomik_Punk! <date>August 11, 2016</date><img src="http://openxcom.org/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;attach=22918;type=avatar" /></dt>
  <dd>What's up fellow Canuck! Great work with this mod; I really enjoy the conceptual tweak (I.e. overheating) 
  that you introduce with the laser weapons. Have you ever considered adding a laser sniper rifle to your mod? 
  I think it would add a nice compliment to the current offerings, that being having a long range, high TU laser 
  option- you know, to really "reach out and touch" some E.Ts  ;D.</dd>

  <dt>tomme25 <date>August 10, 2016</date><img src="http://openxcom.org/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;attach=15298;type=avatar"/></dt>
  <dd>Looks really nice. I like the new graphic for the weapons.</dd>
  
  <dt>Sputnik <date>August 10, 2016</date></dt>
  <dd>I should say theese guns looks really AWESOME!!! because they looks like cool replica out of original amrs. 
  Still, I will check this mod only after the original vanilla game finished but it looks really promising. 
  And yeah, the topic is formated and written in such way it's a pleasure to read.<br />
  Thank you for the mod!</dd>

  <dt>Meridian <date>August 09, 2016</date><img src="http://openxcom.org/forum/avatars/Actors/Bruce_Willis.jpg"/></dt>
  <dd>Source code on github and comprehensive and nicely formatted documentation? You're my new favourite modder! Good job.</dd>
